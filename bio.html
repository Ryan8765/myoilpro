						"My wife and I found Bill to be obviously extremely professional and knowledgeable from the beginning. He knows the ins and outs and thoroughly understands the "fine print" of the oil and gas business. And he went way beyond the call of duty title for us. We had some discrepancies in our title and he did his very best to help us out. He also volunteered to come and meet with us and we got a lot more insight into what is going on. He proved to us by his own actions why there is a need for experts like him to advise landowners."

						"I have known Bill Pittman, owner of MyOilPro.com, for almost 20 years. I worked closely in a business relationship with him all of 1999 and numerous times since. I have found him to be honest, very intelligent, creative and a person who could be counted on to get things done. He works well with all types of people and is able to communicate effectively with everyone from the workers in the oil patch to boardroom CEOs. He has the qualities any business would want in their corner."

						"I have personally and professionally known Bill Pittman for approximately thirty-five years. During this entire time, he has been involved in the oil business and has acted in a most professional and intelligent manner. I have personally relied on Bill's opinion and councel in a number of investments and decisions. He is in a position through his business and geological education and through his experience as a Petroleum Landman and oil and gas producer to be on top of the dealings in and around Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi and many other states in the USA. I have personally used his services and opinions concerning my own mineral interests and will continue to do so in the future."
