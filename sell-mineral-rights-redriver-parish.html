				<h2>
					Wanting To Sell Mineral Rights In Red River Parish, Louisiana?
				</h2>
				<p>
					Red River Parish, Louisiana (Coushatta, parish seat) is in the outline of the Haynesville shale play. If you own mineral rights in Red River Parish and are interested in selling, you can enjoy a cash payday now by selling your mineral rights and royalty rights. Even if your mineral rights are already leased to an oil and gas company or "held by production" by an old oil or gas well. You can sell all or a portion of the mineral rights or royalties you own.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many reasons a mineral rights owner might wish to sell.
				</p>
				
				<ul class="bulleted">
				    <li>To reduce risk, cash is a sure thing</li>
				    <li>To enjoy a cash settlement to buy something</li>
				    <li>To enjoy a cash payment to provide for retirement</li>
				    <li>Because you are tired of dealing with it</li>
				    <li>Concerns over political risks</li>
				    <li>Knowing that nothing is certain in the oil and gas business</li>
				    <li>Fears of a dry hole or "bad wel" being drilled nearby</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If you own a mineral interest in a property that is paying you royalties and are interested in selling your oil check or gas check rights, we buy such producing interests.
				</p>
				<p>
					A royalty check is paid to lessors of oil and gas leases. The oil royalties or gas royalties are paid each month unless the amount is less than a certain amount. In that event, the oil/gas company pays the mineral owner when his account balance hits a certain threshold, say, $25 or $100, depending on the operator. If interested in selling your mineral rights, no matter how large, call today about your minerals, as nothing is certain in the crazy world of oil and gas. Things change rapidly.
