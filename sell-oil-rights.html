				<h2>
					 Help With Selling Oil Royalties
				</h2>
				<p>
					Those who own mineral rights own a right called the <span class="italic">royalty</span>, which is the right to receive production income from an oil or gas well. These <span class="title">oil royalties</span> or oil rights or <span class="title">gas royalties</span> are usually paid monthly. The one who owns the mineral rights usually owns the executive right, which means he owns the right to explore for oil and gas or the right to grant an oil and gas lease to someone else (usually an oil or gas company) to drill for oil or gas. It doesn't matter whether a property is producing oil or gas or not, the royalties can be sold and have done so since the oil business began. The royalties (whether actual income exists yet or not) have a value as long as a royalty buyer can be found. Of course, that is the key -- finding a <span class="italic">royalty buyer</span>.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Selling Oil & Gas Royalties
				</h2>
				
				<p>
					When some people speak of <span class="italic">oil royalties</span>, they mean that literally because their royalty rights were specified in the deed to be just <span class="italic">oil royalties</span>, not natural gas royalties. But most speak of <span class="italic">oil royalties</span> to mean <span class="italic">oil and gas royalties</span>. For those who wish to sell <span class="title">gas royalties</span>, they usually mean <span class="italic">oil and gas royalties</span>. Either way, it's the same process -- providing pertinent information to a royalty buyer.
				</p>

				<h2>
					Sell Oil Rights / Sell Gas Rights
				</h2>
				<p>
					Other terms often used by owners are <span class="italic">oil rights</span> or <span class="italic">gas rights</span>; these terms are synonymous with mineral rights.. And, synonymous with royalty rights. In some states, one cannot own only <span class="italic">oil rights</span> or only <span class="italic">gas rights</span> regardless what a deed says. When we speak of oil, we mean crude oil and when we speak of gas we mean natural gas (gaseous form), not gasoline, which is refined from crude oil.
